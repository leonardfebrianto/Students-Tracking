IndoorAtlas Android SDK

-- Changelog --
Legend:
    @: optimization
    +: new feature
    #: bug fix
    -: removed feature
    *: note

v.1.4.1-beta:
    +: SDK is now Android API 10 compatible. Note that SDK still has other requirements to work
       properly such as magnetic sensor, accelerometer, gyro and WiFi.
    #: Fixed case where max calibration percentage was returned as 100.0 instead of 1.0

v.1.4.0-beta:
    +: Automatic background sensor calibration. Required time and device movement for reaching full
       calibration has been greatly reduced
    +: Because calibration is maintained continuously, positioning can be started immediately
       without an initial calibration movement. Do NOT wait for
       IndoorAtlasListener#onCalibrationReady() callback in order to start positioning.
    +: Support devices without uncalibrated magnetic sensor (API level < 18)
    @: IndoorAtlas#isCalibrationReady() now always returns true
    -: IndoorAtlasListener#onCalibrationFailed(String) is deprecated and not called anymore
    -: IndoorAtlasListener#onCalibrationInvalid() is deprecated and not called anymore
    -: ErrorCodes#NOT_CALIBRATED is deprecated and not used anymore
    -: CalibrationEvent#IDLE is deprecated and not used anymore
    -: CalibrationEvent#RESTARTED is deprecated and not used anymore
    -: CalibrationEvent#WAITING_FOR_ANDROID_INTERNAL_CALIBRATION is deprecated and not used anymore
    #: Internal bug fixes

v.1.3.3-beta:
    +: JDK6 compatibility

v.1.3.2-beta:
    #: Fixed crash that sometimes occurred in call sequence IndoorAtlas#stopPositioning,
       IndoorAtlas#tearDown
    *: Improved WiFi scanning
    +: Javadocs for floor plan loading

v.1.3.1-beta:
    #: Fixed issue where calibration did not (sometimes) progress
    #: Fixed handling difference between server and client system time
    #: Fixed ServiceState#getHeadingDegrees to return correct values
    +: Improved WiFi scan results handling

v1.3.0-beta:
    +: Improved sensor timestamp handling
    +: Improved sensors reading logic to overcome case where sensor provides very low frequency
       samples
    #: Several bug fixes

v1.0.1-beta:
    #: Fixed submitting explicit position
    #: Fixed previously missing values for ServiceState#getRoundtrip and
       ServiceState#getMessagesInQueue

v1.0-beta:
    @: Amount of data send over network has been reduced up to 90%
    @: Several internal improvements to reduce CPU and memory load
    +: Added possibility to indicate explicit location to positioning service
       (use e.g. with Beacons of other known locations)
